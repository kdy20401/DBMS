Project2 note

unique table id(fd) : 0, 1, 2,,,
in Project2, will only use one table, but more afterwards

Q
1. how to distinguish pages with same page number in different datafile?
2. to use insert/delete/find, should open_table be called only once?
3. there are 4 types of pages but there is only one page structure ->use type-casting
4. how to handle a situation when the length of value is bigger than 120bytes?
5. when passing argument, page number vs address of page 
6. insert_into_node(), insert_into_node_after_splitting()'s first parameter -> parent?
7. when insert key in parent, also insert pagenum!
